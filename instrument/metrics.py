"""
Turn a batch of extractions into feature-ownership metrics.

The headline metric is **routing share**: across N samples, what fraction named
each product as the *primary* recommendation. That's "who owns this feature in
the AI's mind." We also compute mention rate, average position, and a sentiment
tally for context.
